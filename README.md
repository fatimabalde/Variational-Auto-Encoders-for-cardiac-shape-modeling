# VAE for Cardiac Shape Modeling

This repository contains the code and examples related to the project "Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Cardiac Shape Modeling" done for IMA 207 class.
Our main objective was to build a variational autoencoder for 2D heart MRI segmentation slices, and subsequently to analyze its performance and explore the underlying latent space.
